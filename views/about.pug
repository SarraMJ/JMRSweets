        p  A bit about us
        p  We are a group of four third-year university students majoring in computer science. As students we know the struggle to find easy dessert recipes that can be cooked using ingredients that you already have at home.Passionate about cooking and technology we created this website with the idea of simplifying your cooking experience using the incredible power of AI.

JMRSweets takes care of it all for you.
